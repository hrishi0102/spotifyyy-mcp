## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js v16 or higher
- npm
- A Spotify account
- A registered Spotify Developer application

### 2. Create a Spotify Developer App

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)
2. Log in with your Spotify account
3. Click "Create an App"
4. Fill in the app name and description
5. Add `http://localhost:8888/callback` as a Redirect URI
6. Note your Client ID and Client Secret

### 3. Install the Project

```bash
# Clone or download the project first
cd spotify-mcp-server

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### 4. Get Your Spotify Tokens

Edit the `spotify-auth.js` file to include your Client ID and Client Secret:

```javascript
// Replace these with your Spotify app credentials
const CLIENT_ID = "your_client_id_here";
const CLIENT_SECRET = "your_client_secret_here";
```

Then run the authentication script:

```bash
node spotify-auth.js
```

This will:

1. Open a URL in your browser
2. Prompt you to log in to Spotify
3. Ask for your permission to access your account
4. Save the tokens to `secrets.json`

### 5. Build the MCP Server

```bash
npm run build
```

### 6. Configure Claude Desktop

Edit your Claude Desktop configuration file:

- On macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- On Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "spotify": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/full/path/to/spotify-mcp-server/build/spotify-mcp-server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/full/path/to/spotify-mcp-server` with the actual path to your project directory.

### 7. Restart Claude Desktop

Close and reopen Claude Desktop to load the new configuration.

## Usage

When you start a conversation with Claude, you'll first need to set your Spotify credentials:

1. Look at your `secrets.json` file to get your credentials
2. Use the `set-spotify-credentials` tool to authenticate
3. Then use any of the other Spotify tools

## Example Prompts

### Setting Up Credentials

```
I want to connect to my Spotify account. Here are my credentials from secrets.json:

Tool: set-spotify-credentials
Parameters:
{
  "clientId": "your_client_id",
  "clientSecret": "your_client_secret",
  "accessToken": "your_access_token",
  "refreshToken": "your_refresh_token"
}
```

### Basic Commands

Check your account:

```
Can you check who I'm logged in as on Spotify?

Tool: get-current-user
Parameters: {}
```

Search for tracks:

```
Search for songs by Weekend

Tool: search-tracks
Parameters:
{
  "query": "Taylor Swift",
  "limit": 5
}
```

Create a playlist:

```
Create a new playlist called "My Pretty pretty girlfriend"

Tool: create-playlist
Parameters:
{
  "name": "My Pretty pretty girlfriend",
  "description": "For my girlfriend. Created with Claude and the Spotify MCP server"
}
```

### Multi-Step Tasks

Creating a playlist with songs:

```
I want to create a workout playlist with energetic songs. First, search for some high-energy songs. Then create a playlist called "Workout Mix" and add those songs to it.
```

Getting recommendations based on favorites:

```
I like the song "Blinding Lights" by The Weeknd. Can you search for it, then find similar songs, and create a playlist with those recommendations?
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Error: No access token available**: You need to set your credentials first using the `set-spotify-credentials` tool
- **Authentication failures**: Your tokens may have expired. Run the auth script again to get fresh tokens
- **Invalid credentials**: Double check that you're using the correct Client ID and Client Secret

## Notes

- The server stores credentials in memory only
- You'll need to set credentials each time you start a new conversation
- If Claude Desktop restarts, you'll need to set credentials again
